This repo is made thinking about new C++ developers or already expirienced developers who might
want to pick up Cmake as a way to structure and organize their projects.

This repo is divided into projects which will explain step by step the fundamentals of Cmake

This repo is inspired by vectir-of-bool's videos, which have been helpful to me, and I wanted
to pass along the information.

To start using Cmake we first need to install it.
We can do that from the official website. https://cmake.org/download/

Now we need a generator (in plain words it's what going to make our program work)
I'll be using Ninja, but you use your preference one.

To install Ninja we need to head to their website and download it. https://ninja-build.org/

Now for the Compiler you can go with Clang. The download have to be done through their website
http://clang.org/

Now we're all set, feel free to make contributions, this is intended to help the communitty and what amazing way
to do it by communitty's contributions
